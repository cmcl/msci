Paper: Linear type theory for asynchronous session types

-------------------

Present a multithreaded functional language which aims to simplify previous
work on session-based multithreaded functional languages.

Review (29/9/2014):

SPL
wide applicability; network protocols, but more flexible: business protocols
within web services and operating system services (communication layer),
file handling
provide session types in the context of the pi calculus
increasing body of work on more mainstream paradigms e.g. functional and
object-oriented languages

CPL
complex semantics with unrealistic (simple) handling of communication
previous work on asynchronous communication focussed on process calculus not
lambda calculus (functional setting)
previous functional settings used complex type systems

GAP
no formal proof of session type giving upper bound for channel buffer size 

WTD
standard linear type system
subtyping between function types to allow inference and conversion between
linear and non-linear types

ROF
in some cases, can deallocate the buffer given static type information
