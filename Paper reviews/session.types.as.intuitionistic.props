Title: Session Types as Intuitionistic Linear Propositions
Authors: Lu√≠s Caires and Frank Pfenning

SPL (+CPL)
* Previous work utilising linearity in pi calculus based type systems did so in an ad-hoc informal fashion merely taking advantage of it w.r.t typing contexts or channel usage semantics
WTD
* present connection between session types in pi calculus type system and intuitionistic linear propositions
* correspondence between proof reductions/conversion and process reductions/equivalence
* absence of deadlocks
* only consider binary choice -- so do I, link back to this paper
* Differs in server reduction than presented in Wadler paper; only one output term no ?x<y>.Q
* labelled transition system to describe process reductions and performing actions
