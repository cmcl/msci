Title: Session Types as Intuitionistic Linear Propositions
Authors: Lu√≠s Caires and Frank Pfenning

SPL (+CPL)
* Previous work utilising linearity in pi calculus based type systems did so in an ad-hoc informal fashion merely taking advantage of it w.r.t typing contexts or channel usage semantics
WTD
* present connection between session types in pi calculus type system and intuitionistic linear propositions
* correspondence between proof reductions/conversion and process reductions/equivalence
* absence of deadlocks
* only consider binary choice -- so do I, link back to this paper
* Differs in server reduction than presented in Wadler paper; only one output term no ?x<y>.Q
* labelled transition system to describe process reductions and performing actions
* 1 corresponding to the end session type -- the grammar doesn't prevent it from being used as a value within a session e.g. !1.1 which is also possible in GV; is it prevent by the typing rules?
* Distinct linear and non-linear environments
* Singleton right-hand side environments; denotes the communication performed by process P when composed with a process whose communication behaviour matches channels defined in the linear/nonlinear environments of P
* Have a 0 process construct not present in Wadler's system.
* Define sequent calculus for dual intuitionistic linear logic
* Define a typed extraction procedure from a dual intuitionistic linear logic formula to a pi calculus process
* cut elimination in DILL corresponds to process reduction in pi calculus up to structural congruence
