Paper: Engineering Formal Metatheory
Review:

Discussing issues in engineering metatheory for programming languages.
Focus was on the locally nameless representation for binders with names
for free variables and de Brujin indices for bound variables. There was
also novel use of cofinite quantification to rules with bindings to increase
the strength of the induction principles and reduce the amount of renaming
of bound variables (due to freshness issues) significantly. The theory was
tested with formalisations of the simply-typed lambda calculus, System F_sub,
the calculus of constructions. The formalisations followed the POPLMARK
challenge (type soundness, preservation, progress).
