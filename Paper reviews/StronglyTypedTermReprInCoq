Title: Strongly Typed Term Representation in Coq
Authors: Nick Benton, Chung-Kil Hur, Andrew J. Kennedy, and Conor McBride

SPL (+CPL)
* PL researchers stay clear of intrinsic encodings and favour untyped terms with typing judgments with additional typed premises (extrinsic)
* Previous attempts at intrinsic encoding (Sozeau) led to equality coercions (?) having to be performed
WTD
* Describe encoding of simply-typed and polymorphic language in Coq where terms are indexed by types (intrinsic)
