session types modelled as labelled transition systems.

This paper gives a brief description of bounded polymorphism from Gay and Hole
that permits creation of session types if their interaction involves sub-types
of a specified type. The authors claim that bounded polymorphism cannot type
common generic process like a forwarder or proxy process. The requirement for
such a process is to accept two channels and permit input on one and output on
the other with dual session types, s and (dual s). Bounded polymorphism is
inadequate here because we do not wish to restrict the type s to be a subtype
but wish to restrict the channels to be dual of each other. This kind of
polymorphism is referred to as session polymorphism by the authors and it is
the focus of the current paper.

The key insight into allowing the typing of a generic forwarding process is to
allow input on all session types (including the terminal session type, denoted
end) and use "deductive reasoning principles" to deduce that the session type
on which we read can in fact read such a type. Deduction is used on transition
hypotheses for input to obtain new transition hypotheses. During the typing of
an abstract session type in which we have requested input (c?x.P for channel c
with session type S, value x and continuation process P) then in the
continuation process P we assume there exists a transition S -> t with label
?a for fresh type and session type variables a and t.
