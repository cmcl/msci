Formalisation of Session-based Lambda Calculus Type Systems
------------------------------------------------------------

For the Coq development see: ./Coq Developments/msci/

The Makefile should compile both the top-level proof scripts and the UPenn
Metatheory library.

Note the .dir_locals.el file (currently) has a hardcoded directory path for
looking for the Coq files. This file is loaded by Proof General when
interacting with the Coq system. You do not require to change it if you do not
intend to run the development.
