\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

briefly explain the context of the project problem

computing distributed communication rise of internet networked communication
the protocols have an effect on the communication and if the protocol is wrong
distributed communicatin now a propenent is most peoples' daily lives
whether it be posting pictures on social media websites sharing videos
or even so much as sending emails all require a well-defined protocol to
specify the type and order of messages to be sent and received between the two
or more communicating partners
mainstream programming languages used to build such systems often fail to meet
the strong guarantees that the correct type of messages will be sent or that
the ordering between messages is preserved
the rise of e-commerce and increasing reliance on software systems in the
areas of aviation/transport mean that much confidence in these systems is placed thus it is of great importance that there exist strong guarantees of correctness



it is thus clear that the need for
construct an argument for the use of a proof assistant and interactive theorem
proving technologies to formalise a framework for developing type systems
involving session types that are based on lambda calculi so that we can use
such a development to reason about a variety of type systems while minimising
proof effort tie this into an introduction into the subfield of session types
and what they are good for essentially motivating our project in this space
additionally we can introduce the reader to the discipline of interactive
theorem proving and formal methods more generally as a way to formalise
programming languages highlighting the benefits of reusability increased
correctness and something what else could we say i think it would appropriate
to mention that the session types studied so far include both pi and lambda
calculi and it may be beneficil if the reader was informed also the pi
calculus paradigms do not fit well into the existing mainstream programming
language paradigms this seems like it should be in the statement of the problem section down below also i should read more of jtod's slides because this writing just keep writing malarky might just be what i need to pound out the pages because it eliminates thoughts as they come into the head what else adopt and focus we have in the problem statement but perhaps those paragraphs should be re-jigged for up here multithreaded functional programming with linear typing for session types a number of these systems use different type systems but they are based on all the lambda calculus fundamentally so to have a generic framework to encode these variants would save on proof engineering effort as is championed by the POPLMARK challenge aimed at reducing the effort for researchers to code programming language metatheory it provides a library needed to perform various things define various parts of programming languages viewed to be difficult to formalise including handling binders and freshness they also mention handling of linear typing but renege on actually formulating this as part of their challenge they insist it is a future work here is the future

\section{Statement of Problem}

clearly state the problem to be addressed in your forthcoming project. Explain
why it would be worthwhile to solve this problem.

The aim of this project is to develop a framework for formalising lambda
calculus type systems involving session types using interactive theorem
proving (in particular, the system Coq). The motivation for the framework is
that it will enable a whole class of related languages and type systems to be
formalised with little extra proof effort. Inspired by previous work on a
mechanised framework of pi calculus type systems~\cite{Gay:2001:FFP}, we shift
to the lambda calculus to provide a basis on which session types for
mainstream programming languages can be studied whilst taking advantage of
previous proof effort and specialising only for those parts unique to the
particular system.

From the generic framework, a number of directions can be explored including
session polymorphism, session subtyping, and permitting different forms of
aliasing within the type system. The majority of previous session type systems
for mainstream programming languages has focussed exclusively on linear type
systems. One disadvantage of a linear type system is the need to re-bind
objects after each operation~\cite{Gay:2010:LTT}. Principally, we intend to
instantiate the framework with a type system that provides the benefits of
aliasing with the guarantees of linearity, termed ``adoption and focus''. The
``adoption and focus'' type system is non-trivial requiring special language
features, e.g. to manage capabilities which can be thought as a form of object
liveness mechanism, so the framework design must support such flexibility by,
e.g allowing the typing judgements to be extended such that the capabilities
can be included in soundness results. The instantiation will demonstrate that
the framework supports a wide range of languages and type systems providing
researchers the ability to harness the power of formal verification in the
design, implementation and documentation of session-based type systems.

\section{Background Survey}

present an overview of relevant previous work including articles, books, and
existing software products. Critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses
of the previous work.

System F-pop, session polymorphism formalised in Coq, Simon's Isabelle/HOL
development.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Proposed Approach}

state how you propose to solve the software development problem. Show that
your proposed approach is feasible, but identify any risks.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Work Plan}

show how you plan to organize your work, identifying intermediate deliverables
and dates.

I need to perform some formalisation of the system. I should identify the key
issues (linear typing, bindings (as claimed in the literature), etc).
