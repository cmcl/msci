(** The notion of kind is borrowed from

    types in system fÂ°. In Proceedings of the 5th ACM SIGPLAN workshop on
    Types in language design and implementation (TLDI '10). ACM, New York, NY,

    but there is no subsumption rule here. In other words, kinds are just a
    mechanism by which to classify types. The rationale for including kinds is
    to allow a later extension to a System F-pop inspired language.

    In lemmas and theorems, k is used to range over kinds.

    given in Wadler's paper in that a base type is added.
