Hand-written (informal) proofs $=$ Error-prone $+$ Difficult to update
\end{frame}

today i am going to talk about a formalisation effort based on an existing
type system whose properties have previously only been studied
informally. first in order to motivate the previous and current work i shall
make two general observations here. one: distributed communication systems are
becoming increasingly prevalent in modern society. two: the correct
functioning of these systems hinges on the protocol between any two
communicating agents to be well-defined and correctly implemented.

one approach to achieve such correctness guarantees is by using binary session
types. [INTRODUCE BINARY SESSION TYPES HERE]. specifying a communication
protocol then involves providing mutual dual types to the communicating
parties. [a simple example with two processes is displayed].

there has been a lot of activity in this area producing a variety of different
session-based type systems. many systems build on top of previous work adding
more complex features such as asynchronous, polymorphic and recursive session
types. extending informal proofs is error-prone and difficult because it is
not always clear which parts of a system's metatheory is affected by a
change. a formalised system would be interesting to consider. the community
would benefit from a formalised system to aid extension and reduce likelihood
of errors in the proofs.

recent work has provided a logical foundation for understanding session
types. session types correspond to classical linear logic connectives. where
negation in the logic corresponds to the dual property of a session
type. [present example slide of the connectives in classical linear logic and
  their session type interpretation]. the formalisation i will describe today
regards this connection, the system GV/CP originally described by Phil Wadler
was the aim of this project to mechanise it. it provides a basis for further
additions and also provides some properties that may be desirable such as
deadlock freedom. the formalisation provides a means to gain more confidence
in the proofs but also assists in extending them to account for the effects of
additions.
