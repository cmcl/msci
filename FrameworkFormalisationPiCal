Paper: A framework for the formalisation of Pi Calculus Type Systems in
Isabelle/HOL
Author: Simon Gay

Synopsis
---------

Notes
---------
Formalisation of theory separates linear and non-linear types to support in
the future, session types.
The proof development struggles with custom user-defined tactics which cause
the proof assistant to introduce new names into the context. It lacks a robust
design, something a new development could improve upon.

runtime types from Pierce and Sangiorgi's proof of type soundness? [20]
